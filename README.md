# SD Host Controller Interface for Virtual Platforms

This model of an SDHCI controller is an extension for the Virtual Component Modeling Library (vcml)
by Jan Henrik Weinstock. I forked vcml from Jan and added the SDHCI model in the branch [SDHCI_dev](https://github.com/lasseUrban/vcml/tree/SDHCI_dev).

## About me
I am a student of Computer Engineering at RWTH Aachen University and this project is my bachelor thesis.
Feel free to test my model and please give me some feedback :-)
